Hides metabox controls on the write/edit post & page admin screens for each user role. Also controls autosave and revisions saved.

== Description ==

**Post Control** from <a href="http://wp-cms.com/">WordPress CMS Modifications</a> gives you complete control over your write options **for every user level/role**. It not only allows you to hide unwanted items like custom fields, trackbacks, revisions etc. but also gives you a whole lot more control over how WordPress deals with creating content.

Simplify and customise the write post and page areas of WordPress to just show the controls you need. Great for de-cluttering - do you really need those pingback and trackback options... now you can decide what each individual level of user can see and use!

It also features other advanced configuration options like disable autosaves and limit the number of revisions saved.

**NEW** - Remove word count on a per user basis (feature request)

**NEW** - Control exactly how many revisions are saved when you are amending your content or even turn off revisions. This stops your database getting clogged up and is great when you are designing a site!

You can control the display of the following post options for each role level (administrator, editor, author and contributor):

* Post Author (if multiple)
* Post Categories
* Post Comments
* Post Custom fields
* Post Discussion
* Post Excerpt
* Post Featured Image (NEW WordPress 3.1+ support!)
* Post Format
* Post Revisions
* Post Slug (NEW WordPress 3.1+ support!)
* Post Tags
* Post Trackbacks
* NEW - Word count

You can control the display of the following page options:

* Page Attributes
* Page Author (ONLY if multiple)
* Page Custom Fields
* Page Discussion
* Page Featured Image (NEW WordPress 3.1+ support!)
* Page Slug (NEW WordPress 3.1+ support!)
* Page Revisions
* NEW - Word count

You can control the display of the following global post/page options:

* Limit the number of post and page revisions saved (updated for WordPress 3.6 and above)
* Post/Page Media upload
* Disable Autosave
* Disable Post Revisions (updated for WordPress 3.6 and above)

== Installation ==

= First time install =

You can use the built-in WordPress add plugin system to install Post Control once logged into your site, it's quick and easy!

Simply search for 'WP-CMS Post Control' and you can install it straight from your WordPress admin area.

If you want to manually upload and install:

1. Get the latest version of this plugin at the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-cms-post-control/">official WordPress plugin directory</a>.
2. Decompress .zip file, retaining the complete, original file structure.
3. Upload the whole directory `wp-cms-post-control` and all containing files to your plugins directory - normally `/wp-content/plugins/`
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Configure options through `Settings > Post Control`

= Update existing install =

If your server supports it, the automatic plugin update feature of WordPress is the easiest way to keep this plugin updated.

If you are updating via FTP, simply delete the entire folder called `wp-cms-post-control` from your plugins directory and replace with the newest version.

**IMPORTANT** When you upgrade, you should go to the options page and re-save your Post Control options to refresh the settings. In most cases everything will be fine, but this will ensure that if there have been any updates to WordPress the plugin will refresh and update the relevant Post Control options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I'm using WordPress 3.6 (or above) and revisions controls don't work? =

Update to plugin version 2.7 or above, it has been updated to support new revisions controls.

= I'm using WordPress 3.5x and revisions controls don't work? =

The last version of this plugin to support WordPress 3.5x is v2.6, you should think about upgrading when you can - we are ready for you!

= My Slug and Featured image controls don't do anything? =

Your WordPress theme has to specifically support these features, if they are not enabled the controls won't enable the function. Ask your theme designer to update their theme if required!

= I'm using v2.x - the automatic WordPress update isn't working! =

Please use version 2.4 and above to fix this glitch.

= I'm using v2.2x with WordPress 3.0 - post options work but the page options do nothing! =

2.3 (and above) fixes this glitch in WordPress 3.0 - with the introduction of custom post types things have changed a bit and I have now amended the plugin to accommodate this.

= I'm using v2.2x with WordPress 2.9 (or below) - post options and/or other things don't work! =

2.22 was the last version with WordPRess 2.9 conpatibility. If you are using an earlier version of WordPress you really should upgrade - you get lots of cool new stuff and a faster, smarter WordPress!

= I'm using v2.x and I have some error messages appear at the top of the screen. =

2.2 (and above) fixes this glitch - thanks for the feedback!

= I used versions of this plugin prior to v2 and sometimes the controls wouldn't re-appear once deactivated. =

2.0 and above is a complete re-write using a new method to remove the controls. Because of this, these issues are now completely resolved.

= Can you change the options for any user role? =

**YES!** Administrators, editors, authors and contributors can all have different settings.

= Can devious users still reveal the controls if they are hidden using tools like Firebug? =

**NO!** All of the core controls are removed in a completely different way now - not just hidden with CSS. They can't be revealed by hacking the browser rendered CSS, as they are not even rendered to the page anywhere!

= What options get used if I hide a control - like pingbacks and trackbacks? =

The global options you set in the main WordPress options are used.

= How do I delete the option(s) out of my database permanently? =

In v2.1 and above just dectivate the plugin and then delete it using the WordPress plugin page option (not just of your server via FTP!). When the plugin is deleted through WordPress, it also deletes the option(s) from the database options table that are created.

= What happens if I activate/deactivate this plugin? =

In v2.1 the options are set to be persistent - so if you deactivate the plugin and re-enable it, the settings will remain saved. Delete the plugin to delete the saved database options.

= I installed v.2.0 and I dont have autosave and other options =

These are now restored in v2.1 and above. Click on the **core functions** link at the top of the screen, or **Post Control Core** in the sidebar under **Settings** to turn off autosaves, revisions and the Flash uploader.

= It's not working! =

**Make sure you are using the latest version!** V2.0+ is designed for WordPress 2.9 and above. If you are using a version older than that, you will have to use an older version of the plugin - and really should think about upgrading, this plugin is ready for you!

Ensure you have the plugin installed in the correct directory - you should have a directory called **wp-cms-post-control** in your plugins directory. Inside there should be another directory called **inc**.

= What you got planned? =

I've got quite a few things I'd like to do with this plugin, but don't hold your breath waiting for them to happen... you may burst!

= Wow, good work - I LOVE this plugin, and you did it all by yourself? =

What began as inherited code has now been completely re-written in v2.0 to use new methods and best practices in WordPress plugin development by Jonny. The first codebase began as a plugin build by Brady J. Frey and I maintained this version for some time, but version 2 is a complete re-write from the ground up.

== Screenshots ==

1. The first post control admin screen where the main options are set for each user level.
2. The core functions option screen, where more advanced WordPress controls are set.
3. An example of a customised write/edit page - much simpler to use for all your users and clients!
